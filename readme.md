# Full Stack Web Development With Go

```
POC 

This research will form the backend for my ai project  

go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/rekognition

I will assess the accuracy of the video stream camera feed versus the uploaded images for the user
at at a certain level of confidence allow the user to log in. 

A group of people under a user should be allowed to login if their video feed passes.

User images stored in the db. 

End points to allow other apps to use should be exposed
